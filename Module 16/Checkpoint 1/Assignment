Question 1:
Cleaning and exploration data in order to bring out features of the dataset.

Question 2:
a:
 - With raw and informal text there will be punctuation, spelling, and grammatical errors.
 - There will be null input for the ratings.

b:  I would do it based on a 5 star ratings system with comments.  These surveys would be taken from a random group of customers.

Try to identify some potentially useful features that you might derive from the raw data.
How would you derive them and how would you assess the usefulness of those features?
c:  You could see the quality of each product and if it is worth keeping to sell.  You would do this by pulling the reviews for
each product.  You can also see if similar products are rating the same and get rid of similar products that are underperforming to
customers expectations.
